## Active task template

```text
Task: Add an independent Dictation tab.
Scope: Draw only from existing lesson vocabulary in lesson order; offer exactly 15 items per day; require a manual "can write" or "cannot write" mark for each item; persist progress locally; schedule repeats by an Ebbinghaus-style interval plan.
Acceptance criteria: New words begin with lesson 1 in order; a "cannot write" mark makes the item eligible again tomorrow; a "can write" mark increases its review interval; no automatic correctness marking; daily queue never exceeds 15 items; existing learning tab remains available.
Developer branch: feature/dictation-spaced-repetition
Developer state: READY FOR QA
QA result: NOT STARTED
QA evidence / defects: `node --check app.js` and `git diff --check` passed. Interactive browser verification is pending.
dev merge: NOT REQUIRED for the user-approved direct-to-main workflow
Preview: NOT REQUESTED
Human acceptance: WAITING
Next owner: Developer
