## Current snapshot

## 2026-08-19 Multi-book global navigation addition

```text
Task: Add a persistent, header-level “← 切换教材” control to the multi-book learning page.
Acceptance criteria:
- `index.html?book=1-upper`, `2-upper`, `3-upper`, and `4-upper` each show the control at the upper left in the app header.
- The control is visible in both 生字学习 and 每日听写, returns to `welcome.html`, and makes no localStorage or progress mutation.
- Desktop, iPad, and narrow mobile layouts keep the title unobstructed.
Developer branch: feature/add-multi-grade-data
Developer worktree: F:\chinese webapp\.worktrees\add-multi-grade-data
Developer state: Done - header-level switch-book control implemented; no commit created.
QA result: PASS
QA evidence / defects: Independent QA on the uncommitted `feature/add-multi-grade-data` candidate: `node --check app.js` and `git diff --check` passed. The `switch-book-button` is in the static App Shell header before `#app-tabs`, so it remains present for both learning and dictation views. Its click handler only sets `window.location.href = "welcome.html"`; the handler contains no storage mutation. At <=640px `.topbar-left` becomes a left-aligned column with an 8px gap, preserving the title. Static assertions passed for all of these conditions. Browser interaction was not run.
dev merge: Not allowed — awaiting QA PASS

## 2026-08-19 Multi-book dataset integration

```text
Task: Integrate user-provided Grade 1, Grade 2 and Grade 4 character datasets and complete multi-book loading.
Developer branch: feature/add-multi-grade-data
Developer worktree: F:\chinese webapp\.worktrees\add-multi-grade-data
Developer state: Done — `a56c6d4 feat: add multi-grade book datasets`
QA result: Waiting
QA evidence / defects: Parser validation passed for all four available books (1-upper: 25 lessons/100 chars; 2-upper: 35/250; 3-upper: 23/250; 4-upper: 25/250). `node --check` passed for app, welcome, and catalog scripts; `git diff --check` passed. Browser interaction remains for QA.
dev merge: Not allowed — awaiting QA PASS
Next owner: QA
```

## 2026-08-19 Audio fallback and write-before-review

```text
Task: Fix audio fallback and enforce write-before-review daily dictation.
Developer branch: feature/fix-audio-dictation-flow
Developer worktree: F:\chinese webapp\.worktrees\fix-audio-dictation-flow
Developer state: Done — `ad0ec06 fix: fallback audio and require dictation writing`
QA result: PASS
QA evidence / defects: Independent QA passed exact `a983df0` / `ad0ec06`: syntax and diff checks; mocked error, rejected play, synchronous throw, and timeout each produced one TTS fallback; human `onplaying` suppressed fallback; the daily flow has no manual bypass, gates assessment on every HanziWriter completion, and fails closed without HanziWriter. Browser/iPad interaction remains unexecuted.
dev merge: Completed — `0bb73cb merge: fix audio and dictation flow`
Next owner: Manager

| Field | Current state |
| --- | --- |
| Last updated | 2026-08-17 — Daily Dictation commit 7954325 integrated into dev after QA PASS |
| Manager | Active — daily dictation preview coordination |
| Developer | Done — daily dictation feature integrated |
| QA | PASS — commit 7954325 |
| Current task | Daily Dictation first — legacy-aligned flow; memory redesign deferred |
| Branch | `dev` |
| Worktree | Integration: `F:\chinese webapp\.worktrees\daily-dictation-dev` |
| QA status | PASS — 15-item persisted queue, reveal control, listening, Tianzige and manual self-assessment verified |
| Preview status | Not requested / not verified — dev contains 7954325 |
| Human acceptance | Waiting — main release forbidden without explicit approval |

## 2026-08-17 Daily dictation handoff

```text
Task: Complete the old-version-style daily dictation flow before any memory/spacing redesign.
Acceptance criteria: Daily queue is capped at 15; each prompt has a listen action; pinyin and word answer are hidden until the learner chooses to reveal them; each word character has a Tianzige handwriting area; learner manually marks “我会写 / 我不会写” after writing; queue and result persist locally. Memory/spacing redesign is out of scope.
Developer branch: feature/dictation-interaction
Developer worktree: F:\chinese webapp\.worktrees\dictation-interaction
Developer state: Done — `7954325 feat: align daily dictation flow`
QA result: PASS
QA evidence / defects: `node --check app.js` and `git diff 7954325^ 7954325 --check` passed. QA confirmed queue cap/persistence, hidden pinyin and answer, listen control, Tianzige/HanziWriter targets, manual self-assessment and next-item progression.
dev merge: Completed — fast-forwarded to `7954325`
Preview: Not requested
Human acceptance: Waiting

## 2026-08-18 Welcome start-button repair

```text
Task: Repair the welcome-page “开始学习” control reported as unresponsive.
Acceptance criteria: Clicking the default Grade 3 Upper start control must enter `index.html?book=3-upper`, including when the external welcome script does not execute; normal welcome-script behavior remains intact.
Developer branch: feature/start-learning-button-fix
Developer worktree: F:\chinese webapp\.worktrees\start-learning-button-fix
Developer state: Done — `427ff63 fix: make welcome start control navigate reliably`
QA result: PASS
QA evidence / defects: QA independently verified exact `427ff63`: clean worktree, `node --check welcome.js`, `node --check app.js`, and `git diff 427ff63^ 427ff63 --check` pass; a DOM-stub test confirmed the fallback invokes `window.location.assign('index.html?book=3-upper')`, preserving the only enabled Grade 3 Upper selection.
dev merge: Completed — merged as `e633745 merge: repair welcome start control`
Preview: Ready locally — http://127.0.0.1:4173/welcome.html (HTTP 200)
Human acceptance: Waiting

## Active task template

```text
Task: Add an independent Dictation tab.
Scope: Draw only from existing lesson vocabulary in lesson order; offer exactly 15 items per day; require a manual "can write" or "cannot write" mark for each item; persist progress locally; schedule repeats by an Ebbinghaus-style interval plan.
Acceptance criteria: New words begin with lesson 1 in order; a "cannot write" mark makes the item eligible again tomorrow; a "can write" mark increases its review interval; no automatic correctness marking; daily queue never exceeds 15 items; existing learning tab remains available.
Developer branch: feature/dictation-spaced-repetition
Developer state: READY FOR QA
QA result: NOT STARTED
QA evidence / defects: `node --check app.js` and `git diff --check` passed. Interactive browser verification is pending.
dev merge: NOT REQUIRED for the user-approved direct-to-main workflow
Preview: NOT REQUESTED
Human acceptance: WAITING
