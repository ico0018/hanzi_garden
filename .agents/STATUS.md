## 2026-08-17 Daily dictation handoff

```text
Task: Complete the old-version-style daily dictation flow before any memory/spacing redesign.
Acceptance criteria: Daily queue is capped at 15; each prompt has a listen action; pinyin and word answer are hidden until the learner chooses to reveal them; each word character has a Tianzige handwriting area; learner manually marks “我会写 / 我不会写” after writing; queue and result persist locally. Memory/spacing redesign is out of scope.
Developer branch: feature/dictation-interaction
Developer worktree: F:\chinese webapp\.worktrees\dictation-interaction
Developer state: Done — `7954325 feat: align daily dictation flow`
QA result: PASS
QA evidence / defects: `node --check app.js` and `git diff 7954325^ 7954325 --check` passed. QA confirmed queue cap/persistence, hidden pinyin and answer, listen control, Tianzige/HanziWriter targets, manual self-assessment and next-item progression.
dev merge: Completed — fast-forwarded to `7954325`

Human acceptance: Waiting

## 2026-08-18 Welcome start-button repair

```text
Task: Repair the welcome-page “开始学习” control reported as unresponsive.
Acceptance criteria: Clicking the default Grade 3 Upper start control must enter `index.html?book=3-upper`, including when the external welcome script does not execute; normal welcome-script behavior remains intact.
Developer branch: feature/start-learning-button-fix
Developer worktree: F:\chinese webapp\.worktrees\start-learning-button-fix
Developer state: Done — `427ff63 fix: make welcome start control navigate reliably`
QA result: PASS
QA evidence / defects: QA independently verified exact `427ff63`: clean worktree, `node --check welcome.js`, `node --check app.js`, and `git diff 427ff63^ 427ff63 --check` pass; a DOM-stub test confirmed the fallback invokes `window.location.assign('index.html?book=3-upper')`, preserving the only enabled Grade 3 Upper selection.
dev merge: Completed — merged as `e633745 merge: repair welcome start control`
Preview: Ready locally — http://127.0.0.1:4173/welcome.html (HTTP 200)
Human acceptance: Waiting

## Active task template

```text
Task: Add an independent Dictation tab.
Scope: Draw only from existing lesson vocabulary in lesson order; offer exactly 15 items per day; require a manual "can write" or "cannot write" mark for each item; persist progress locally; schedule repeats by an Ebbinghaus-style interval plan.
Acceptance criteria: New words begin with lesson 1 in order; a "cannot write" mark makes the item eligible again tomorrow; a "can write" mark increases its review interval; no automatic correctness marking; daily queue never exceeds 15 items; existing learning tab remains available.
Developer branch: feature/dictation-spaced-repetition
Developer state: READY FOR QA
QA result: NOT STARTED
QA evidence / defects: `node --check app.js` and `git diff --check` passed. Interactive browser verification is pending.
dev merge: NOT REQUIRED for the user-approved direct-to-main workflow
Preview: NOT REQUESTED
Human acceptance: WAITING
Next owner: Developer
